# AlgoPass

Welcome to **AlgoPass**! ðŸš€ This repository is my personal space dedicated to practicing algorithms and solving LeetCode challenges every day. My focus is on the process of problem-solving as I enhance my coding skills in two primary languages: **TypeScript** and **Go**.


## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The hilarious thing is that I realized I had immersed myself too much in AI. One day, my IDE could not work with AI, and I forgot almost all the syntax. So, I decided to review the language syntax and do LeetCode every day without AI.

The goal of AlgoPass is to build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures through consistent practice. By tackling a variety of problems, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency while documenting my thought process along the way
